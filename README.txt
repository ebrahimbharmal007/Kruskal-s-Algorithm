Design, code, and test a C program to determine a Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (EMST) for a set of 2-d points interpreted as the vertices of a weighted undirected graph
Input is to be read from standard input:
1. The first line is one integer value: n, the number of points.
2. The remaining n lines will each contain two ints defining a point as an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate.

Processing:

This code is given the value of x and y coordinate and then it computes the weight which is the distance between two coordinates using the distance formula.
While executing Kruskal’s method, you should indicate the positions of the two points for each edge, the distance between them, and whether the edge is included in the EMST or discarded. Your code may terminate as soon as n-1 edges have been included.
